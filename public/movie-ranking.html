<h2>3 Movies i'll Never Tire of Watching</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>It's got action, interesting characters, and a story line that intrigues me on every level. I won't let myself watch it too many times as I don't want to runi it! But every time I watch it I find something new. It's super clever and gets you thinking.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>There is a theme here with my love of sci-fi. I am a sucker for a film with a clevr concept that takes you on a full journey. The first Matrix is a classic for a reason!</p>
<h3>The Holiday</h3>
<p>I thought best to mix it up for my last pick. I love all genres when done well, and this is a film that never fails to make me smile at Christmas. I watch it every single year and i'm stil not board. I love the characters, the way all the storylines overlap and come together, and the overall development. A must watch for anyone still yet to do so.</p>
